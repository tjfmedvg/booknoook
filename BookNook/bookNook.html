                        In <strong>This Story Is a Lie</strong>, Tom Pollock creates a gripping psychological thriller about 17-year-old math genius Peter Blankman, who's struggling with crippling anxiety. Everything gets out of control when his scientist mother is stabbed and his twin sister Bel disappears, bringing Peter into a conspiracy including secret experiments and some crazy family secrets. As a secret agency is pursuing him, and he doesn't know who to believe, Peter must use reason, memory, and perception to discover the truth. With good plotting and an unreliable narrator, the book distorts the smudges between reality and illusion in a story of identity, mental illness, and betrayal.

            <p>An intriguing story about a 17 year old boy named Peter. Peter is a math genius, but he also suffers with his mental health. One day his mother is stabbed and sister vanishes. Peter works with "57," a secret agency, to find his sister and help his mother survive. Truth and perception are question throughout the book through the unreliable narrator used. Peter's mental illness doesn't help with the unreliable part. Overall I rate this book a <strong>4.6 out of 5</strong>. There are better books out there but this one was amazing. I would recommend any reader to read <strong>Linked</strong> by Gordon Korman or the <strong>Quarantine</strong> Series by Lex Thomas. Both have aspects of mystery, a teen protagonist and political struggle.</p>
